# Microservice with grpc

## Introduction to gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for building remote procedure call (RPC) APIs. It uses the Protocol Buffers data serialization format and allows for the communication between services in a variety of programming languages. gRPC is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, making it a popular choice for building microservices and other distributed systems.

## Introduction to Protocol Buffers

Protocol Buffers is a data serialization format that allows for the encoding and decoding of structured data. It is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol Buffers are used by gRPC to define the structure of messages that are exchanged between services.
